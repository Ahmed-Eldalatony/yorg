# Idea 
- A youtube addon (or an app with using go) for the browser that will scrape all your watch later  list on youutbe, then organize it using ai.  
# Details
- every category can have nested category too.
- the extestion will have the abiltiy to make this list is the home of youtube if user wanted. 
- or maybe make it the start page for the browser.
- you can give the addon a custom prompt so it make a list with your own needs.
- The addon well have the ability to scrape the transcription of the video to and convert it to a nice blog (should test this first)
